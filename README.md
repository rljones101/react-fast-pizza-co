# React - Fast Pizza Co

This is a simple project using React, Tailwind CSS and Redux Toolkit. It simulates the idea of users purchasing pizzas, managing their purchases through the menu or via the cart. Setting a priority and showing the aggregated cost.

## Setup

### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
